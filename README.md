### Recommended

Useful VS Code extension for developing Azure Static Web Apps: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestaticwebapps

## Run

The following command will start both API and frontend application.

```sh
dev/start
```

- You can open http://localhost:4280/ in your browser.
- `dev/start` runs also `graphql-codegen --watch` to generate GraphQL types implementations when you modify GraphQL schema.
- Frontend app hot-reloads by Vite dev server and API app restarts by nodemon when the code generation occurs or you modify some codes.

### API only

Run only API app by the following command.

```sh
cd api
yarn dev
```

- Open http://localhost:7071/api/graphql in your browser to launch GraphQL Playground.
- API app restarts by `nodemon` when you modify some codes.
